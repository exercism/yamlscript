# In a discussion in https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/pull/794 and
# https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/issues/335 it has been decided to
# only include numbers between 0 and 31 (00000 to 11111) in the canonical
# test data.
# 
# This is to allow for different implementations in different tracks and
# not restrict solutions to bitwise or modulo-based algorithms.
# 
# Tracks may include additional tests for numbers > 31 in their test
# suites. In this case, 32 (100000) should yield the same result as 0,
# 33 (100001) should yield the same result as 1, and so on.
