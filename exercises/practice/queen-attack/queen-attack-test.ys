# Testing invalid positions will vary by language. The expected value of
# 'error' is there to indicate some sort of failure should occur, while a 0
# means no failure.
# Some languages implement tests beyond this set, such as checking for two
# pieces being placed on the same position, representing the board
# graphically, or using standard chess notation. Those tests can be offered
# as extra credit.
# 
# All row and column positions are considered to be zero-indexed array
# indices, where the first row - with index 0 - represents the top of the
# board, and the first column - with index 0 - represents the left of the
# board. In chess notation that is a8.
